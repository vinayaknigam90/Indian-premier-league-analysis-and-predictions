# PREDICTING-IPL-MATCH-WINNERS
 There are 2 datasets deliveries.csv and matches.csv. The deliveries dataset has 150,461 records of deliveries. The matches dataset has information of 636 matches. We will have to combine the dataset to obtain total records more than 190,000 records as each match has more than 300 deliveries. Moreover the dataset does not have any null values. Since the dataset is heterogenous (as it is combined from multiple datasets), it has large number of records we feel that it is appropriate for this project.
